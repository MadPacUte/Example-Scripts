# Example-Scripts

This repo is being used as a place to hold example scripts that are used. Hopefully these can help other users (as well as me) understand how to get started using the example files.

Some common ones will be connecting to a database, simple processing, cleaning techniques, etc. As I encounter issues found in my scripts or things I think are helpful, they will be placed into this repo.
